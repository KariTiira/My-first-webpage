# My first webpage 

The assignment was to desing a webpage with Figma and create it with the tools we wanted to. 

I used tailwind and vs code in the process. The page includes only the landing page. 

Unfortunately I'm not very artistic so the design is awful an dull, but hey! It's my first!

As you can see, it has a very simple and oldish style so I can imagine it for a small accounting company which was established during the 90's and hasn't changed much since. Not very promoting or exciting design but it has everything you need for a small company (I think).
